<br>

<br>

## Creating a Database 

```CREATE DATABASE my_database;```

## Creating a Databse User
We are goint to create a new user which we will use to conntect to and interact with the database.Set a good password.
<br>
```CREATE USER my_user WITH PASSWORD 'password';**

## Optional 
    We can modify a few operations of the connection parameters for the user we just created. This will speed up database operations, so that the correct values do not have to be queried and set each time a connection is established.
    <br>
    We are setting the default encoding to **UTF-8**, which DJango expects. We also setting the default transaction isolation scheme to "read committed", which blocks reads from uncommited transactions. Lastly, we are setting timezone.
    Django projects will be set to use UTC. 
    
    So:
    ```
    ALTER ROLE my_user SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
    ALTER ROLE my_user SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read commited';
    ALTER ROLE my_user SET timezone TO 'UTC';
    ```
