Use the present perfect to show a finished past action. 
Examples:
- I have been to Paris.
- She has visited the pyramids in Egypt.

If we need to emphasize that the action will continue into the future, we can use the present perfect progressive tense (have /  has  + been + ing - verb).

Example:
- I have living abroad for five years. 

- She has traveling through Asia since Junuary. 

## Notes

**Since** is used to indicate the starting point of an action.


### **Some randome exersices**:
- Have you ever been to Europe?
- She has already left on her vacation.
- We still haven't flown on an airplane. 

## Present Perfect

We use the present perfect tense for two reasons. The present pefect can show a finished past action. 

For example:

The present pefect can also show a continuing action. It show an action that started in the past and continues to the present. This action may continue in the future too.

Example:
- I have lived in Toronto for two years.
