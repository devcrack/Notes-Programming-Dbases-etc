# A Pragmatic Philosofy


Be a pramgatic programmer is more about an attitude, a style philosophy of approaching the problems and their solutions. You have to think beyond  the inmediate problem, placing it in its larger context and seeking out the bigger picture.
Another key to their succes is that Pragmatic Porgrammers take responsability for everything they do. Pragmatic Programmers won't sit idly by and watch their projects fall apart through neglect. 

## Topic 1 It's your life


_I'm not in this world to live up to your expectations and you are not in this world to live up to mine. Bruce Lee_

Is your life i mean you ownt it, you run it you create it to your ways.

Many Developers are frustate, they are stagnating in their job, techonology passed them by. Usually they feel under appreciate, or underpaid, or their teams are toxic. Maybe they want to move away in a work from home.

Why they can't change it?

Software development must appear close to the top of carrers where you have control. Our skilsl are in demand, our knowledge crosses geographic boundaries, we can work remotely. We are paid well so ?.

For some reason the developers seem to resist change, They stay in a passive state waiting with the hope things will get better. The transform in a mediocre creature with skills out dated.

**You have agency**
<br>
You can change your organization or change your organization

If tecnology seems to be passing you by, make time(your own time) to study new stuff that looks interesting. You are investing in your self.

You want a better work, a work remotely? Find some who hire you. 

This  industry gives you a remarkable set of opportunities. Be proactive and take them.

## Topic 2 The cate Ate my source code

_The greatest of all weaknesses is the fear of appearing weak.
J.B Bossuet_
<br>
A pragmatic programmer take chage of their own carer and aren't afraid to admint ignorance or error. This will happen even in the best of projects. Despite through testing, good documentation, and solid automation, things go wrong. Deriveries are late. 
<br>
This things happen, and we try to deal with them as professioanlly as we can, we must own up to our shortcomings, our ignorance and our mistakes.

### Team trust

Trust in a team is absolutely essential for creativity and collaboration. In a healthy environment based in trust, you can safely speak your mind, present ideasm and realy on members who can it turn rely on you. 

Imagine you are working in a project with your team, after of months of planning and delicate execution, you've made it on deploying, now its your turn to set up the last piece of code but you say: Sorry folks i dont finish it ye, the cat was playing with the computer and fuck my code. 
<br>
That sort of breach of trust might be hard to repair.

### Take Responsability 

Responsability is something you actively agree to. You make a commitment to ensure that something is done right. You must to analyze the situation for risk that are beyond your control. You have right not to take on a responsability for an impossible situation. Make the call based on your own values and judgment.


When you do accept the responsability for an outcome, you should expect to be held accountable for it and when you make a mistake or and error judgment, admit it honestly and try offer options.

Don't make up an excuse, don't blame any body. You work is to provide solutions, not excuses.

### Provide Options, Don't make lame excuses

Before you approach anyone to tell why something can't be done, Talk with your self, and think: Does your excuse sound reasonable, or stupid? How's it goin to sound to your boss?
<br>
Instead of excuses provide options.
Don't say it can't be done; explain what can be done to salvage the situation. 

Perhaps you need additional resources to complete this task. Don't be afraid to ask, or to admit that you need help.

### Software Entropy

Maybe the sofware decvelopment is inmune from almost all physical laws, but entropy hit us hard. 

Entropy in phisics refers to the amount of 'disorder' in a system.
When disorder increases in software we call it **software rot** or technical debt. 

The most importan factor to contribute to software root seems to be psychology, or culture, at work on a project. Even if you are a team of one, your project psychology can be ver delicate thing.

Hopelessness can be contagious. Ignoring a clearly broken situation reinforces the ideas that perhaps nothing can be fixed, that no one care, all is doomed; all negative thoughts which can spread among team members, creating a vicious spiral.

If you see that entropy maybe can win then you'd better plan on getting another job, don't let entropy win.

### First do no harm

A badly designed piece of cod, a poor management decision that the team must live with for the duration of the project is all it tkaes to start the decline. If you are working in a project with quite a few broken windows, it's all too easy slip into the mindset of "All the rest of this code is crap, I'll just follow suit"

By the same token, if you find yourself on a project where the code is pristinely beatiful cleany written, well desing and elegant, you will likely take extra special care not to mess it up. 

## Topic 4

You may be in a situation where you know exactly what needs doing and how to do it. It's time to bring out the stones. Work out what you can reasonably ask for. Develop it well. Once you've got it, show people, and let them marvel. People find it easier to join an ongoing succes. Show them a glimpse of the future and you'll get them to rally around. 

### Be a catalyst for change

Focus too tightly. Marvel your pairs your boss make that they think only in one thing and forget the rest of the world. We all fall for it, every day. Things just creep up on us. 

Projects and inexorably get totally out hand. Systems drift from their specifications feature by feature, while patch after patch gets added pieces of code unitil there's nothing of the original left.**It's often the accumulation of small things that breaks morale and teams.

Always try to keep an eye in the big picture. Constanly review what's happening around you, not just what you personally are doing.


## Topic 5 Good Enough Software

_Striving to better, oft we mar what's well. Shakespeare, King Lear


You can discipline yourself to write software that's good enough, good enough for your users, for future maintainers, for your own peace of mind. You'll find that you are more productive and your users are happier. 
<br>
All systems must meet their user's requirements to be succesfull, and meet basic performance, privacy and security standars. Give the opportunity to your users participate in the process of deciding when what you've produced is godd enough for their needs.

Would be unprofessional to ignore the users requirements simply to add new features to the program. Is unprofessional  promise give time scales and to cut basic engineering corners to meet a deadline

### Tip Make a Quality a Requirements Issue

Great software is often preferable to the fantasy of perfect software tomorrow. If you give your users something to play with early, their feeedback will often lead you to a better eventual solution.


Don't spoil a perfectly good program by overembellishment and overrefinement. Move on, and let your code stand in its own right for a while. It may not be perfect. Don't worry: It could never be perfect.

# Topic 6 Your Knowledge Portfolio

_An invest in knowledge always pays the best interest Benjamin Franklin_


Ben really hit the nail on head. Your knowledge and experience are you most important day to day professional assets.

As your knowledge becomes outdate and therefore your knowledge  value declines, so does your value to your company or client. 
We want to prevent this from ever happening.
<br>
<br>
Your ability to learn new things is your most importan strategic asset.

## Your knowledge portfolio 

Managing a knowledge portfolio is very similar to managing a financial portfolio:

1. Serious investors invest regulary --as habit.
2. Diversification is the key to long term success.
3. Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high risk, high reward investment.
4. Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return.
5. Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically.

To be succesful in your career, you must invest in your knowledge using the guidelines of above.

Managing this kind of investment is a skill just like any other, so can be learned. The trick is to make yourself  do initially and form a habit. Develop a routine which you follow until your brain internalizes it. At that point you sucking up new knowledge automatically. 

## Build your portfolio 

### Invest regulary 

Invest in your knowledge portfolio regulary, even if it's just a samll amount. The habit is as importan as the sums, so plan to use consisten time and place, away from interrumptions.

### Diversify 

The more different things you know, the more valuable you are. The more technologies you are comfortable with, the better you will be able to adjust to change. And don't forget all the other skills you need, including those in non techical areas.

### Manage the risk 

Not invest all in something that maybe collapse tomorrow technology exists along a spectrum from risky, but nor should you invest all of it conservatively and miss out on possible opportunities. Don't put all your techinical eggs in one basket.

### Buy low, sell high 

Learning emerging technology before it becomes popular can be just as hard as finding an undervalued sotck, but the payoff can be just as rewarding.

### Review and rebalance

This is a very dynamic industry. Maybe you need to brush up on that database technology that you haven't used in a while, or perhaps you could be better possionated for that new jop opening if you tried out that other language...

### **Tip 9 Invest regualary in your knowledge portfolio**

### Learn at least one new language every year

Different languages solve the same problems in different ways. By learning several different approaches, you can help your thinking and avoid getting stuck in a rut.

### Read a technical book each month

For deep understanding you need read long form books. Search technicall books on interesting topics to your current project. Once you are in the habit, read a book a month. After have mastered the technologies you are currently using, branch out and study some that don't relate to your project.


### Read nontechnical books, too

Is important to remember that computers are used by people, people whose needs you are trying to satisfy. 
You work with people, are employed by people, and get hacked by people. 
Don't forget the human side of the equation, as that requires an entirely different skills(usally called soft skills, they are actually quite hard to master).

### Take classes 

Look for interesting courses and go to conferences.

### Participate in local user groups and meetups


Isolation can be deadly to your carreer, find out people are working on outside  of your company. Don't go and just listen: actively participate.

### **Experiment with different environments**

If you are worked only in windows, spend some time with Linux. If you have used only makefiles and an editor, try a sophisticated IDE with cutting edge features and vice versa

### Stay current 

Read news and post online on technology different from that of your project. 

Is important to continue investing. Once you feel comfortable with some new language or bit technology, move on. Learn another one.

The process of learning will expand your thinkingm opening you new possibilities and new ways of doing things. Try to understand the functional programming paradigm and you write code differently and so on.


All this reading and research takes time, and time is already short supply. Always have something to read in an otherwhise dead moment.
