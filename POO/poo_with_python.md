## What is an object?
An object is a collection of data with associated behaviors. 

An object combines data (the properties and attributes) and functions (usually called methods). The data represents the state of the object and the methods represent the behavior and operations that the object can perform.   
Object oriented means functionally directed toward modeling objects. 


### Properties 

Properties is data that represents characteristics of a certain object like weigh, color and size. Some times the properties are read only. 

## Behaviors

Behaviors are actions that can occur on an object. The behaviors that can be performed on a specific class of object are called methods. The methods are like simple functions in structured programming but with the big difference that the methods have access to all the data associated with this object.
