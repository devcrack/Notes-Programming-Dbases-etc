# Data Model

## Objects, values and types
  
Everything in python are objects basically. Objects are python's abstraction for data. All data is represented by objects or relations 
between objects.

Every object has an identity, a type and a value. The identity for an object never changes once it has been created, you can think about 
the identity like the address in memory of the object, in fact the opertator **is** compares the identity of two obejcts; the **id()** 
function returns an integer representing its identity.
