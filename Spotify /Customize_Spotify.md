First of all you need to install Spicetify from [Install Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/docs/advanced-usage/installation/#note-for-linux-users)

Then merely you need to give permission on Spotify files through: 
```bash
sudo chmod a+wr /opt/spotify
sudo chmod a+wr /opt/spotify/Apps -R
```

For more details about this go to: https://spicetify.app/docs/advanced-usage/installation/#note-for-linux-users


Finally get [spicetify themes](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes) and follow the repository instructions.
